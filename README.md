##  📌 What is the Pair Extraordinaire Badge?
The Pair Extraordinaire badge is awarded when you co-author commits with another developer on GitHub.

- Symbol: Two people 🤝 working together
- Purpose: Represents teamwork & collaboration in coding
- Unlock: ✅ Earn it by using Git’s Co-authored-by feature in commits

---

## 🔻 Requirements:

- ✅ **Co-author required** – commit must list at least two authors
- ✅ **Public repositories only** – commits in private repos don’t count
- ✅ **Verified email** – commit emails must match GitHub account emails
- ✅ **Commit pushed to default branch** – typically main or master

> ⚠️ **Important**: Just making a PR is not enough you need a commit with co-authors.

### 👉 Four Ways to Earn the Pull Shark Badge

---

### 1️⃣ Solo + Co-Author Method

- **Create a repository**:
    - Name: github-pair-extraordinaire-badge-guide
    - Public + README

-  **Make a change with co-author line**:

```bash

git commit -m "Add demo commit for Pair Extraordinaire badge Co-authored-by: YourFriend <friend@example.com>"

```

-  **Push the commit**
-  **Check commit on GitHub → it should show two authors**

>  ✅ Badge progress achieved!

---

### 2️⃣ Contributor Method (Collaboration)

-  **Work with a friend: Fork → branch → code changes**
-  **Add Co-authored-by line in your commit**:

```bash

Co-authored-by: Teammate Name <teammate@example.com>

```

-  **Open PR → Merge into default branch → badge progress**

---

### 3️⃣ IDE Method (VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA)

-  **VS Code**:
    -  Use **GitHub Pull Requests** & **Issues extension**
    -  Add co-author in commit dialog (VS Code supports **Co-authored-by**)
    -  Commit + push → merge

-  **IntelliJ IDEA**:
    -  Commit changes → in commit message box → add co-author line manually
    -  Push → merge PR

---

###  4️⃣ Git CLI Method (Terminal)

-  **Clone repo**

```bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-pair-extraordinaire-badge-guide.git

cd github-pair-extraordinaire-badge-guide

```

-  **Create branch**

```bash

git checkout -b pair-extraordinaire-branch

```

-  **Make change**

```bash

echo "🤝 Pair Extraordinaire demo file" >> demo.txt

```

-  **Stage & commit with co-author**

```bash

git add demo.txt

git commit -m "Add Pair Extraordinaire demo

Co-authored-by: Friend Name <friend@example.com>"

```

-  **Push & merge → badge progress**

🎯 Done via Git CLI!

##  ⏱️ When Will the Badge Appear?

-  Usually within minutes on Profile → Achievements
-  Sometimes up to 24 hours

>  **Note**: If not showing → make another co-authored commit

---

## 🏅 Badge Levels

The **Pair-Extraordinaire** badge uses an "x" multiplier system:

| Level       | Requirement            | Badge Display          |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Initial** | 1 co-authored commit   | Pair Extraordinaire x1 |
| **Bronze**  | 10 co-authored commits | Pair Extraordinaire x2 |
| **Silver**  | 24 co-authored commits | Pair Extraordinaire x3 |
| **Gold**    | 48 co-authored commits | Pair Extraordinaire x4 |

> **Note**: The "x" number indicates achievement level, not separate badge types

---

## 🚫 Important Limitations

❌ **What Doesn't Count**
    -  Private repo commits
    -  Commits without Co-authored-by line
    -  Fake/non-verified emails
